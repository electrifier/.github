## @electrifier 
# intro

electrifier is a project i've been working on in my spare time for some years now.


I've re-written several parts many times. It's just a fun project to test out what's happening in .net - world. The Original .net-version just brought tab-support to Windows File Explorer 🙌 🎉.

When I heard about WinApp SDK last year, I was very excited. I never used WPF for perfomance reasons, but I love WinUI. I also like using @dahall/Vanara from @dahall. It's a great project, for everyone who's interested. It's not that other WinAPI-Abstraction Layer but a complete shell around about every API. And It's a great source for good practices.
